# Phonebook
best terminal Phonebook based on Ncurses and SQLite3, import export CSV functions

This terminal based Phonbook works on Linux and have a lots of functionality to manage personal contacts. The user interface is based on Ncurses, the managment of strings is based on SDS Library (you can found a fork in my repository), and the Database Engine is SQLite3 than you can manage all the data as you want, there is also CSV Export and Import functionalities, Duplicate merging function, Sorting function.

You need to install Ncurses and SQLite3 libraries first (search on Google how to install)

Than you need my version of SDS library based on antirez original: https://github.com/Sandroid75/sds.git

At the end also for CSV functionality you need this library: https://github.com/Sandroid75/libcsv.git

Enjoy
