# Phonebook
best terminal based Phonebook with Ncurses and SQLite3, CSV import and export functions.

This terminal based Phonbook works on Linux and have a lots of functionality to manage personal contacts. The user interface is based on Ncurses (TUI), the managment of strings is based on very fast solution as SDS Library (you can found a fork in my repository with extra functions), and the Database Engine is SQLite3 than you can manage easly all the data as you want, there is also CSV Export and Import functionalities, Duplicate managing functions, Sorting function and so on. You can propouse or develop a new functionality as you want...

You need to install Ncurses and SQLite3 libraries first (search on Google how to install them)

Than you need my version of SDS library based on antirez original: https://github.com/Sandroid75/sds.git

At the end also for CSV functionality is needed this library: https://github.com/Sandroid75/libcsv.git

Enjoy
