# Phonebook
best terminal based Phonebook with Ncurses and SQLite3, CSV import and export functions.

This terminal based Phonbook works on Linux and have a lots of functionality to manage personal contacts. The user interface is based on Ncurses (TUI), the managment of strings is based on very fast solution as SDS Library (you can found a fork in my repository with extra functions), and the Database Engine is SQLite3 than you can manage easly all the data as you want, there is also CSV Export and Import functionalities, Duplicate managing functions, Sorting function and so on. You can propouse or develop a new functionality as you want...

You need to install Ncurses and SQLite3 libraries first (search on Google how to install them)

Than you need my version of SDS library based on antirez original: https://github.com/Sandroid75/sds.git

You need also my log library:  https://github.com/Sandroid75/log.git

At the end also for CSV functionality is needed this library: https://github.com/Sandroid75/libcsv.git

This code was made by Sandroid75 to illustrate various C language powers.
My recommendations for developing robust C code are:
 - first of all read The C Programming Language: ANSI C Version by K&R (C);
 - after read K&R keep always in mind rules and methods;
 - one of the most characteristics and powers of the C is the pointers;
 - pointers are very helpfull and flexibile to write efficient code;
 - pointers can be dangerous for stable code if you forget the rules;
 - if you use pointers for list of datas don't forget to reserve memory;
 - if you use pointers for list of datas don't forget to release memory;
 - write well-formatted code;
 - only good formatted code makes the code readable;
 - good formatting code reduces the risk of errors;
 - good formatting code facilitates the debugging;
 - good formatting code facilitates the maintenences;
 - good formatting code facilitates future implementantions;
 - commenting the code is another good and necessary practice;
 - commenting the code means understanding what you are doing;
 - commenting the code means understanding what you have done;
 - commenting the code is not a waste of time;
 - at the last but not least, remember rules and methods;
